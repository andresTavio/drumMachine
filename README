Drum Machine created using Google's Web Audio Api

It is still under construction

About:

This drum machine utilizes various new features in HTML5. The sound uses Google's Web 
Audio API (Javascript), and the slider controls use the "range" input tag.

Usage:
	
The rows of the grid correspond to different instruments. Select a
 pattern by clicking on the buttons, 
then press the "Start Loop"
 button. The speed of the loop can be controlled with the "Tempo"
 slider. 
There are currently two filters, one is a high-pass filter
 and the other is a low-pass filter, both can be 
controlled by their
 corresponding sliders.

******Currently supported in Chrome and Safari ONLY********

The source needs to be run on a local server due to
the XML requests made to load the sounds.
